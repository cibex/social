On the messages from threads, a reply button is shown.
Once it has been pressed, a composer with the reply is shown.

To activate the separation of the reply body add the system parameter "mail_quoted_reply.separate_reply_body".
After opening a composer with the reply button the reply body will be shown below the mail body as readonly.
To write into the reply body uncheck "Reply Readonly". For longer replies this can take some time.
